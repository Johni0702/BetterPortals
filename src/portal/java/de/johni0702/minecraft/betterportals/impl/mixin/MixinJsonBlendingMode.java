     * For some reason someone at Mojang though it'd be a great idea to skip the GL calls when the previous blend state
     * equals the current one. The thing they forgot about is the rest of the game which doesn't use this class but
     * nevertheless modifies the GL blend state...
     *
     * This assumption is so bad in fact, that even the Shader class itself already breaks it by unconditionally
     * disabling blending before rendering. As a result, a second bug has gone unnoticed: The blend mode of the
     * entity_outline program is incorrect (should be no blending but specifies standard alpha blending and since the
     * last step of the outline pipeline also specifies standard alpha blending, the update for the first step does
     * nothing and keeps the already-disable blending state around).
     *
     * Side note: The lazy GL state updates in GlStateManager.blendFunc seem broken as well when taking
     * GlStateManager.tryBlendFuncSeparate into account.
